# Student Attendance Sheet
The student attendence sheet project was created to record student names to keep track of who arrived to class.

# How It's Made:
**Tech Used:** HTML5, CSS3, JQuery
First I created a function that would initiate when clicked. Then I will extracted the string value from the input and pushed it to an array. After, I created another onclick function that will appened li children to the dom. I also ceated another function that removes all li children. 

# Optimizations
Would build this in Vanilla Javascript and include local storage.

# Lessons Learned:
First attempt with JQuery and I learned how to code shorthand syntax to target elements from the dom.
